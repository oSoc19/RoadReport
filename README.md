# About the project
With Road Report, cyclists and pedestrians can easily report problems they encounter on the road. For example, broken bike paths, holes in the road or loose cobblestones.

In this way citizens support the city to discover problems at an early stage, so the city can improve the quality of the walking and cycling paths!

Road Report is a project of [TMaaS](https://drive.tmaas.eu), built by [The Guardians of the Road](https://2019.summerofcode.be/2019/road-report) at [Open Summer of Code 2019](https://2019.summerofcode.be/).
